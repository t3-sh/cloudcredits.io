## Contribution Guide

Welcome! There are many ways to contribute—from writing code to adding program listings or simply spreading the word. Let’s build **CloudCredits.io** together.

### 1. Code Contributions

- **Tech Stack**  
  - **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) (static, no SSR), React components, Tailwind CSS  
  - **Animations:** Framer Motion  
  - **Search:** Pagefind

- **Features & Priorities**  
  - We prioritize features from the roadmap and those most upvoted in Discussions. Feel free to fix bugs anytime!

- **Feature Workflow**  
  1. **Propose** a feature in Discussions.  
  2. If it gets enough community support (upvotes), the team converts it into a GitHub issue.  
  3. **Ready to Implement**: You can pick it up if it's unassigned.  
  4. **Not Converted Yet?** Check in with the core team first. Sometimes there are blockers or other plans.

- **Pull Requests**  
  - Fork the repo, make changes, and open a PR. Please reference the issue you’re resolving or feature request if applicable.

- **Good First Issues**  
  - Look for the “Good First Issue” label if you’re new to the codebase or want a simpler task.

### 2. Program/Listing Contributions

- **Criteria**  
  - Must be legit and beneficial programs (e.g., cloud/SaaS credits) from recognized companies.  
  - Should bring **real** or **significant** value to founders, open source projects, or builders.  
  - No shady offers or questionable “gotchas.”

- **Format & Quality**  
  - Follow the existing listing structure for consistency.  
  - Provide official links and accurate details.  
  - We reserve the right to reject listings that require invasive requirements or have questionable practices.

- **What’s Not Allowed**  
  - Invasive or predatory offers.  
  - Listings that function solely as lead generation without real user value.  
  - Tools that compromise user privacy or cause more harm than good.

### 4. Sponsorship & Advocacy
