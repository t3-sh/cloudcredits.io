# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The CloudCredits.io team takes security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please email **security@t3sh.com** with the details. Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested mitigations. We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and aim to provide an initial response within 7 business days.

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. If you need to encrypt your report, request our PGP key in your initial message.

## Scope

This policy covers the CloudCredits.io website, infrastructure, and all code in this repository. Third-party services we rely on should be reported directly to the service provider.

## Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach. Once a fix is available, we will credit you (if desired) and publish a summary of the issue and remediation steps.
