  Hootsuite’s HootGiving Program offers significant, perpetual discounts on its
  social media management platform to help registered charities and nonprofits
  grow awareness, engage communities, and raise more funds. Participating
  organizations receive full-featured Professional or Team plans—including bulk
  scheduling, OwlyWriter AI content assistance, real-time analytics, and a
  unified inbox—while saving an average of three hours per week on social
  execution. Validation is handled via TechSoup or Percent, and well-known
  nonprofits like WWF and UNESCO already leverage the program.
