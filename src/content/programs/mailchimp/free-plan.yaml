faq:
  - question: "What happens when I reach 500 contacts?"
    answer: "Once you reach 500 contacts, you cannot add new contacts until you remove existing ones or upgrade to a paid plan. Existing contacts remain accessible and you can continue using other features."
  - question: "What happens if I exceed 1,000 monthly emails?"
    answer: "You cannot send new campaigns until the next month or until you upgrade to a paid plan. Scheduled campaigns may be paused, but your account and previous data remain accessible."
  - question: "Can I remove Mailchimp branding from emails?"
    answer: "No, the Free Plan includes 'Powered by Mailchimp' branding in all emails. You need to upgrade to a paid plan to remove this branding."
  - question: "Is there a time limit on the Free Plan?"
    answer: "No, the Free Plan is available forever with no time restrictions. It's not a trial - it's a permanent free tier."
  - question: "What support is available on the Free Plan?"
    answer: "Free Plan users have access to email support only. Phone and chat support are available with paid plans."
  - question: "Can I upgrade anytime?"
    answer: "Yes, you can upgrade to any paid plan at any time directly from your account dashboard. Your data and contacts will be preserved during the upgrade."
