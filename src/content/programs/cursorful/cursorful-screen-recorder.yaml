description: >-
  Cursorful is a browser-based screen recorder that captures your desktop and
  automatically pans and zooms to follow the cursor based on click activity. It
  features an editor for fine-tuning zoom positions, depths, and timing, custom
  or preset backgrounds, and toolbar hiding for clean visuals. Videos can be
  exported in multiple aspect ratios and are rendered locally, ensuring privacy.
  The free plan offers unlimited exports and core features, while the Pro plan
  unlocks commercial licensing, camera and microphone support, 4K exports,
  lifetime offline access, and one year of future cloud features and desktop
  application access.

faq:
  - question: Will my videos be uploaded to Cursorful's servers?
    answer: >-
      No, unless you explicitly opt in to cloud features, videos are rendered
      and stored locally on your machine and never leave the browser.
  - question: Do you support Firefox?
    answer: >-
      Firefox is not supported due to missing extension features and
      architecture limitations.
  - question: What triggers the automatic zoom?
    answer: >-
      Automatic zoom activates when two or more clicks occur within a
      three-second window; follow-cursor zoom continues as long as clicks keep
      happening, and you can adjust or remove zooms in the editor after
      recording completes.
  - question: Does Cursorful record the entire desktop or just the browser?
    answer: >-
      Cursorful records the entire desktop then automatically crops to the
      browser; if you switch to another application, recording continues but
      follow-cursor and auto-zoom are disabled until you return to the browser.
  - question: Do you offer a student discount?
    answer: >-
      There is no student discount; the Pro license already includes a $40
      early-bird discount, and additional discounts are not available due to the
      costs of future cloud features support.
