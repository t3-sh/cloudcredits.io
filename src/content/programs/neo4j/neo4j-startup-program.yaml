intro: >-
  The Neo4j Startup Program supports innovative startups by providing access to
  the world’s leading graph database and advanced graph technology tools,
  enabling startups to build and grow scalable, data-driven applications.
description: >-
  The program offers two main benefits. First, Neo4j Aura™ for Startups provides
  a cloud-based graph database service with affordable pricing at 9 cents per
  GB-hour, complete with monitoring, upgrades, backups, Neo4j Bloom, and the
  APOC library. Second, eligible startups receive a free Neo4j Enterprise
  License that enables mission-critical applications with support for multiple
  production, test/staging, and development machines. Eligibility requires 50 or
  fewer employees, less than $3MM USD annual revenue, and a willingness to share
  startup success stories. This program is designed for venture-backed,
  angel-backed, or self-funded startups that use Neo4j to directly support their
  business operations.
