faq:
  - question: Is the Neo4j AuraDB free plan really permanent?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Neo4j AuraDB Free Plan is designed to be 'free forever' with no
      hidden charges or expiration dates. Users can maintain their free instance
      indefinitely as long as they comply with the terms of service.
  - question: What happens if I exceed the 50,000 node limit?
    answer: >-
      The system will prevent adding additional nodes once the limit is reached.
      Users will need to either remove existing data or upgrade to a paid plan
      to continue adding data.
  - question: Can I use the free plan for commercial applications?
    answer: >-
      The free plan is intended for development, testing, and proof-of-concept
      work. For production commercial applications, Neo4j recommends upgrading
      to AuraDB Professional or Enterprise plans.
  - question: How do I resume a paused database?
    answer: >-
      Paused databases can be resumed instantly through the AuraDB console or
      by attempting to connect with any Neo4j driver. The resume process is
      automatic and requires no manual intervention.
  - question: Is my data backed up on the free plan?
    answer: >-
      Yes, Neo4j manages automatic backups for free tier instances. However,
      users are responsible for their own data export if they need additional
      backup security.
  - question: Do I need a credit card to sign up?
    answer: >-
      No, the Neo4j AuraDB Free Plan requires only email verification for
      signup. No credit card or payment information is needed to access the
      free tier.
  - question: What happens during the automatic pause after 3 days of inactivity?
    answer: >-
      The database pauses to conserve resources but all data remains intact
      with zero data loss. You can resume instantly through the console or by
      connecting with any query, and the process is completely free.
  - question: Can I get enterprise support with the free plan?
    answer: >-
      The free plan includes community support through Neo4j's forums and
      documentation. Enterprise support requires upgrading to paid AuraDB
      Professional or Enterprise plans.
