intro: >-
  New organizations receive $400 in free credits to trial CockroachDB Cloud,
  available across all cluster plans.
description: >-
  CockroachDB Cloud offers a $400 free trial credit for new organizations to
  explore its fully managed, distributed SQL database service. The credits are
  automatically applied to the first $400 of costs for any cluster, whether
  using Standard, Advanced, or Basic plans. Users receive email notifications
  about usage milestones, and a 30-day grace period is provided after the trial
  ends to prevent data loss. A payment method must be added before the trial
  concludes to ensure continuous service. Tools are available for cost
  estimation and transitioning to monthly billing.

faq:
  - question: How long do the free trial credits last?
    answer: >-
      The duration depends on cluster size; larger clusters may consume the $400
      credits in about 10 days, while smaller clusters can last up to 30 days.
  - question: Can invited users receive free trial credits?
    answer: >-
      Only the first organization created by a user qualifies for the free
      trial; invited users share the existing organization's credits.
  - question: What happens after the free trial ends?
    answer: >-
      Once the free credits are used up or expire, monthly billing begins
      immediately, and a 30-day grace period is provided to add a payment method
      before clusters are deleted.
