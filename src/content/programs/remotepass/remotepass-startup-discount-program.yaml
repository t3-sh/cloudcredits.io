faq:
  - question: Who qualifies for the RemotePass Startup Program?
    answer: >-
      Any early-stage company worldwide that has raised less than US$5 million
      (typically pre-seed, seed, or Series A) and is not an existing RemotePass
      customer.
  - question: Can startups with more than $5 million in funding participate?
    answer: >-
      The core discount is limited to startups under the $5 million threshold,
      but RemotePass can create bespoke packages for growth-stage companies
      through direct consultation.
  - question: Is the promotion available to current RemotePass customers?
    answer: >-
      No. The listed discounts and the free month apply only to new enrollments
      initiated through the startup program application flow.
  - question: How long do the discounts last?
    answer: >-
      For contractor services, the first month is free and the following nine
      months are 33% off. Employee payroll services receive a 15% discount for a
      full 12 months.
  - question: What savings can startups expect compared to standard pricing?
    answer: >-
      Participants typically reduce first-year global hiring and payroll costs
      by 40–60% relative to RemotePass’s standard enterprise plans.
