faq:
  - question: What usage is included in the Cloudflare R2 free tier?
    answer: >-
      The free tier covers 10 GB-month of Standard storage, 1 million Class A
      operations, 10 million Class B operations, and free data transfer when
      accessing R2 directly each month.
  - question: Does the free tier apply to Infrequent Access storage?
    answer: >-
      No. The free allowances only cover the Standard storage class and do not
      apply to the Infrequent Access tier.
  - question: Are egress fees waived when using the R2 free tier?

      Yes. Data transferred directly from R2 through the Workers API, S3 API, or
      r2.dev domains does not incur egress charges.
