  TikTok's Ads Manager Welcome Gift program offers new advertisers a lucrative
  opportunity to kickstart their campaigns with dollar-for-dollar matched
  credits. Unlock benefits through tiered spending thresholds: spend $100 to
  receive $100, $500 to receive $500, $1,500 to receive $1,500, or scale up to
  $6,000 in matched credit by spending $6,000. After registering a new account,
  participants have a 30-day redemption period to reach their desired tier, with
  credits applied 1-7 days after meeting spending requirements. The program
  integrates organic and paid strategies, such as Spark Ads, to maximize
  campaign impact, and is limited to new TikTok Ads Manager accounts in selected
  regions.
