faq:
  - question: Can I extend the trial?
    answer: >-
      No – the free trial is strictly 14 days. After it ends, you must upgrade
      to a paid plan to continue using Pro features.
  - question: What happens to my data when the trial ends?
    answer: >-
      All workflows, Zaps, and settings remain intact after the trial. Your
      account reverts to the free tier and you can continue using any Zaps
      within free plan limits.
  - question: Do I need to provide payment information?
    answer: >-
      No – the trial does not require a credit card and will auto-expire unless
      you choose to upgrade.
  - question: Can I downgrade mid-trial?
    answer: >-
      Yes – you can switch to the free plan at any time, and Pro features will
      be disabled immediately.
