intro: >-
  Y Combinator startups receive $50,000 in free Fivetran usage for 12 months,
  plus technical support and onboarding resources.
description: >-
  Fivetran’s Startup Program gives eligible Y Combinator companies access to
  fully managed data-pipeline infrastructure without cost during their earliest
  stage. Participants obtain $50 K of credits on the Standard plan,
  complimentary technical support, and guided tutorials and workshops. Two
  tailored promotions—Standard Fivetran and Powered by Fivetran—cover internal
  analytics use cases or embedding customer-source pipelines inside a product,
  helping founders focus on building rather than maintaining ETL processes.
