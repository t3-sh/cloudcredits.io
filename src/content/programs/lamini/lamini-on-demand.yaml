  Get $300 in free credit to explore Lamini On-Demandâ€™s high-performance GPU
  cluster for LLM tuning and inference with no long-term commitments.
description: >-
  Lamini On-Demand provides a self-service, pay-as-you-go platform for running
  LLM tuning and inference jobs on a high-performance GPU cluster. New and
  existing users receive $300 in free credit to get started. Inference is billed
  at $0.50 per million tokens, covering input, output, and JSON structured
  responses. Tuning costs $1 per step on one GPU, scaling linearly with
  additional GPUs for faster performance. Users benefit from advanced features
  like memory tuning for mixture-of-experts models, guaranteed JSON output, and
  flexible burst across GPUs. Credits can be purchased in $100 increments via
  the account dashboard. For enterprise-scale needs, Lamini also offers Reserved
  GPU clusters and Self-Managed licenses for on-premise or air-gapped
  deployments.
