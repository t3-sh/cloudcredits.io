  Earn up to 1M free API tokens daily by sharing API data and feedback to
  enhance model performance while retaining control over your data.
description: >-
  OpenAI's Data Sharing Incentive Program allows eligible organizations to
  contribute API data—including prompts, completions, evaluations, and
  Playground feedback—in exchange for up to 1M free API tokens per day. The
  program is designed to improve AI model performance through targeted feedback,
  with features like granular control over sharing settings, automated PII
  redaction for privacy protection, and built-in content safety filters.
  Participation requires a non-enterprise OpenAI API account with organization
  owner privileges, and it excludes Zero Data Retention customers. Tokens are
  allocated on a 24-hour rolling basis, and unused tokens do not roll over.
