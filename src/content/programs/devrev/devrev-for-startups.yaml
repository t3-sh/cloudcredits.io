faq:
  - question: Who is eligible for DevRev’s startup credits?
    answer: >-
      Startups backed by an incubator, accelerator, or VC with funding up to
      Series A that are new customers and affiliated with DevRev’s partner
      ecosystem can apply.
  - question: How are the $10K credits distributed?
    answer: >-
      DevRev grants $6,000 in credits immediately after approval and releases an
      additional $4,000 once the startup completes key onboarding milestones
      such as integrations and training.
  - question: Are bootstrapped startups allowed to join?
    answer: >-
      No, the program currently requires outside funding (incubator,
      accelerator, Seed, or Series A). Bootstrapped companies may instead begin
      with DevRev’s free trial.
  - question: What is the timeline for application review?
    answer: >-
      Most applications are reviewed within 5–7 business days, though additional
      time may be needed for eligibility verification.
  - question: How does the 50 % follow-up discount work?
    answer: >-
      After the 12-month credit period ends, startups have six months to commit
      to a paid annual plan and receive a 50 % discount on that next-year
      subscription.
