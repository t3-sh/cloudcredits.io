faq:
  - question: When are characters deducted?
    answer: >-
      Characters are deducted each time you “Convert” or “Re-Convert” text to
      audio. Re-converting deducts the full character count again because the
      entire text must be processed.
  - question: What happens if I run out of characters?
    answer: >-
      You can purchase additional character packs at any time if your plan quota
      has been exhausted.
  - question: Do unused characters roll over to the next cycle?
    answer: No. Unused characters reset at the start of each new subscription period.
  - question: Can I receive a refund?
    answer: >-
      Payments for one-time packs or subscriptions are generally non-refundable.
      Contact support if you experience a technical issue immediately after
      purchase.
  - question: How does canceling my subscription affect my content?
    answer: >-
      You retain any unused characters until the end of the billing cycle, but
      features such as embedded audio players or podcast hosting stop
      functioning after cancellation. Audio already used commercially remains
      valid.
  - question: Can I upgrade or downgrade later?
    answer: >-
      Yes. You may upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time by
      contacting support.
  - question: Do you offer other discounts?
    answer: >-
      Beyond this program, PlayAI currently offers only the 20% discount for
      students, educators, and nonprofits.
