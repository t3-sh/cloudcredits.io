faq:
  - question: Who is eligible for the $10K Adaline API credits?
    answer: >-
      Only team workspaces—rather than individual accounts—that are among the
      first 100 eligible sign-ups after general availability qualify for the
      $10,000 credit package.
  - question: Is there a deadline to claim the credits?
    answer: >-
      The offer remains open until the 100-workspace cap is reached; teams are
      encouraged to sign up quickly to secure their spot.
  - question: Do the credits expire?
    answer: >-
      No. Once granted, the $10,000 in API credits remain in your workspace
      account until they are fully consumed.
  - question: What happens if my team signs up after the first 100 slots are filled?
    answer: >-
      Teams beyond the first 100 will still receive Adaline’s standard free tier
      but will not receive the additional $10,000 credit package.
  - question: Can multiple people on my team use the credits?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Credits are attached to the workspace and can be used collaboratively
      by all invited team members.
