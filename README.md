**[CloudCredits.io](https://cloudcredits.io)** is the biggest open source vault of startup tools and credits. We track 200+ verified startup business tools, software deals, and cloud credits worth $2M+ — curated by founders, for founders. Zero ads. Zero affiliates. Zero tracking.

## Overview

CloudCredits.io is powered by AI agents that continually surface official startup programs, scrape fresh deal terms, and keep this repository up to date. Maintainers review each addition so founders, builders, students, and operators can rely on accurate information when extending runway or prototyping new ideas.

## Who It's For

- Founders and builders shipping new products without burning runway
- Startup teams standardizing their tech stack across cloud, AI, and SaaS
- Students, hackers, and indie makers looking for verified free tiers and credits

## What You'll Find

- Hand-picked business tools and software deals from our open source community vault — perfect for bootstrapped startups and growing companies
- Cloud & infrastructure credits, AI and ML tooling, analytics platforms, marketing automation, and productivity suites that match the categories on our [homepage](https://cloudcredits.io)
- Plain-language summaries of eligibility, benefits, and application steps so you can move fast

## How We Keep Deals Fresh

1. AI agents monitor official provider announcements and scrape trusted sources for updates
2. Maintainers verify legitimacy, remove noise, and commit structured program data
3. The repository is updated on a best-effort basis to keep all programs current and actionable

## Contributing

Please review the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting changes or opening issues. Roadmap ideas are also tracked on the public [2025 roadmap](https://cloudcredits.io/roadmap).
